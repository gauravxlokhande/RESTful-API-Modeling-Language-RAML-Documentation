Creating a folder structure for RAML involves organizing your API specifications, types, examples, and other related files in a coherent manner. Here's a suggested folder structure for organizing RAML files:

```
/api
│
├── api.raml                # Main RAML file defining the API
├── annotations.raml         # File containing annotation types
├── examples.raml            # File containing examples
├── extension.raml           # File containing API extensions
├── library.raml             # File containing reusable libraries
├── overlay.raml             # File containing API overlays
├── resourceTypes.raml       # File containing resource types
├── security.raml            # File containing security schemes
├── traits.raml              # File containing traits
├── types.raml               # File containing data types
└── documentation
    └── overview.md         # Markdown file for API documentation
```

### Explanation:

1. **api.raml**: This is the main RAML file that defines your API endpoints, base URI, versioning, protocols, and includes references to other RAML files and libraries.

2. **annotations.raml**: Contains custom annotation types used to add metadata to your RAML specification.

3. **examples.raml**: Includes concrete examples demonstrating valid data structures and values for different types and resources in your API.

4. **extension.raml**: Contains extensions to the base API definition, adding additional functionality or details for specific use cases or versions.

5. **library.raml**: Centralizes all reusable components such as types, examples, annotations, security schemes, traits, and resource types into a modular structure.

6. **overlay.raml**: Contains overlays that extend the base API definition to add or modify properties without altering the original specification, catering to different environments or configurations.

7. **resourceTypes.raml**: Defines reusable resource types that encapsulate common behaviors and properties shared across multiple resources.

8. **security.raml**: Specifies security schemes used to authenticate and authorize access to API endpoints, such as OAuth 2.0 configurations or API key requirements.

9. **traits.raml**: Contains reusable sets of properties (traits) that can be applied to methods across different resources, like standardizing query parameters or response headers.

10. **types.raml**: Defines data types used within the API, specifying the structure, properties, and validation rules for request and response bodies.

11. **documentation/overview.md**: This folder can contain markdown files (`*.md`) that provide detailed documentation about the API, including overviews, usage examples, and explanations of functionality.

### Folder Structure Benefits:

- **Modularity**: Each RAML component (types, examples, traits, etc.) is encapsulated in its respective file, promoting reusability and maintainability.
  
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to locate and update specific parts of the API specification.

- **Clarity**: Ensures that API documentation and examples are easily accessible and understandable, aiding both developers and API consumers.

This structure provides a solid foundation for managing RAML-based API projects, facilitating collaboration, version control, and documentation efforts effectively. Adjust the structure as per your specific project requirements and organizational preferences.
